##Simple Python File Categorizer Source Code
If your folder is messy and a lot of different files are in that folder, and you want to tidy down that files,this simple program can help you do it in a second and categorize them based on their extension.
for now this program only works on windows.i'll develop this to support other operating systems like linux,mac and more:)

But you need to do a few things to make this program to run
*first,you have to install python 3.x. you can download it from [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
*then,you have to install pyperclip package using the following command:
    ``` pip install pyperclip ```
*then simply run python categorizer.py (make sure you are in the directory that contains categorizer.py)

if you copy the path you want to the clipboard,the program automatically validates the path and run the code.
when you run the program , it asks you the folder name for categorized files.default is "categories".
then the program asks you the postfix for every categories based on your file extension.the default is "files"
